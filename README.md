# Code In The Dark

### Set Up

1. Install dependencies - `npm install`
2. Start the server (for Round 1) - `npm run r1` (Round 2 = `r2`)
3. Prep your external monitor
    * Open a new Chrome window
    * Drag it to your external monitor
    * Goto `http://localhost:8080`
    * Go Fullscreen - `ctrl + cmd + f`
    * Turn of the toolbar - `shift + cmd + f`
    * Open the dev tools - `option + cmd + i`
    * Turn on the device toolbar - `shift + cmd + m`
    * Set it to `iPad` and rotate to `1024 x 768`
    * Undock the dev tools to a separate window (get 'em out of the way)
4. Face your monitor away from you

### Game On
Open the `index.html` for the current round in the editor of your choice.  The notes at the top include the HEX values for any colors used, the `font-family` names for the non-native fonts used (be sure to include the quotes), and paths (and natural dimensions, should you need) for all images used.

Open the `mock.png` (e.g. in Preview or another browser window).
